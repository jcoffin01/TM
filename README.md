This is an extremely minimal imitation of the processes tab in the Widnwos Task Manager. It shows a list of processes, a *little* bit of information about each, 
and has a button to kill tasks (to prevent some accidents, you need to double-click on a process in the list to enable the the "End Task" button.

This gets its data from different sources than the Windows Task Manager does, so the memory usage it shows can and will differ a little bit.
It also shows a few services that don't show up in the Task Manager process tab (but I believe do show in the Serviced tab).

This was thrown together in a few hours to help answer a question in Stack Overflow, so it's intended as a simple starting point, not a polished, finshed product. The functionality
is incomplete, and the UI is rough around the edges--and in the middle, and everywhere in between.
