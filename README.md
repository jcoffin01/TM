This is an extremely minimal imitation of the processes tab in the Widnwos Task Manager. It shows a list of processes, a *little* bit of information about each, 
and has a button to kill tasks (to prevent some accidents, you need to double-click on a process in the list to enable the the "End Task" button. The data it shows
for memory usage doesn't come from the same source as the Task Manager appanently uses, so the two can and will differ a little bit.
